    abstract = {{This paper presents a formal description of a small functional language with dependent types. The language contains data types, mutual recursive/inductive definitions and a universe of small types. The syntax, semantics and type system is specified in such a way that the implementation of a parser, interpreter and type checker is straightforward. The main difficulty is to design the conversion algorithm in such a way that it works for open expressions. The paper ends with a complete implementation in Haskell (around 400 lines of code). We are going to describe a small language with dependent types, its syntax, operational semantics and type system. This is in the spirit of the paper  ” A simple applicative language: Mini-ML ” by Cl\'{e}ment, Despeyroux, and Kahn [5], where they explain a small functional language.}},

abstract = "The Cartesian closed categories have been shown by several authors to provide the right framework of the model theory of λ-calculus. The second author developed this as a syntactic equivalence between two calculi, giving rise to a new kind of combinatory logic: the categorical combinatory logic, where computations can be done through simple rewrite rules, and, as usual with combinators, avoiding problems with variable name clashes. This paper goes further (though not requiring a previous knowledge of categorical combinatory logic) and describes a very simple machine where categorical terms can be considered as code acting on a graph of values (the essential actions are LISP's “cons” and “cdr”, as well as “rplacd” to implement recursion). The only saving mechanism is a stack containing pointers on code or on the graph. Abstractions are handled in the very same way as in P. Landin's \{SECD\} machine, using closures. The machine is called categorical abstract machine or CAM. The \{CAM\} is easier to grasp and prove than the \{SECD\} machine. The paper discusses the implementation of a real functional programming language, ML, through the CAM. A basic acquintance with λ-calculus is required. "
